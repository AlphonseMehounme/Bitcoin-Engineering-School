## 🏆 Introduction

The Bitcoin Engineering School is the place where developers find all the ressources needed to become great Bitcoin & Lightning Enginners.
We started the project to first help ourseleve deep dive into the Bitcoin engineering Rabbit Hole and second help other dev and engineers like who would like to contribute to Bitcoin.
It has been a really and challenging journey so far but we have the first version.

With this first version 0.1 of the platform, anyone who would like start working on Bitcoin can join Bitdev or LN Dev course, get ressources and test codes.
